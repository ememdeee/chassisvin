        "answer": "Yes, in some cases, you can use a license plate number to check a vehicle's warranty status. However, this method is less common and may require additional verification. VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is the preferred method because it provides a more detailed and accurate report. Tools that support license plate lookups often cross-reference the plate with the VIN for comprehensive results."

Check for Recalls: Even if your warranty is expired, manufacturers may still cover specific repairs due to recalls.

          "answer": "A factory warranty is provided by the vehicle’s manufacturer and covers defects or issues arising from manufacturing errors for a set period or mileage. Common examples include bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties. An extended warranty is additional coverage purchased after the factory warranty expires. It can be offered by manufacturers or third-party companies and typically covers repairs or replacements beyond the original terms. Extended warranties often have customizable plans and can vary widely in cost and coverage."
