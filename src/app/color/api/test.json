          "title": "Engine Belt - Replace",
          "description": "Several types of engine belts need to be replaced from time to time. Vehicles from 1990 and newer typically have a serpentine belt. The belt snakes around the pulleys located at the front of the engine (or the side of a transverse-mounted engine) and drives multiple accessories including the alternator, power steering pump and air conditioning compressor. If it is squeaking or worn, it could break, which would make the engine inoperable. Check it at 60,000 miles but change it before 100,000 miles. Older vehicles usually have separate belts for the water pump, alternator, radiator fan and air conditioning system, but when they break, you still may be able to get home. Finally, engine timing belts help to keep the camshaft and crankshaft in sync so that pistons and valves operate in sync. They typically last from 60,000 to 90,000 miles. A broken timing belt could result in engine damage and an expensive rebuild.  ",

The engine control unit (ECU) is a computer that controls all of your vehicle’s electronic systems. Like many computers, it occasionally requires reprogramming of its operating software.

On occasion, other vehicles revert to limp-home mode following an ECU malfunction. In order to diagnose what needs to be done, a dealership technician will connect a computer to the vehicle’s On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) port.

Fuel injectors will typically last between 50,000 and 100,000 miles. Much of this lifespan is determined by the type of fuel used and how often the vehicle’s fuel filters are changed. Some symptoms that your fuel injectors need replacing include an illuminated check engine light, a decrease in fuel efficiency, a smell of fuel (especially near the fuel injectors under the hood) and engine misfiring. Fuel injector replacement is a job best performed by an ASE-certified mechanic at a dealership service department or automotive service center. ",

Or if you hear a whirring sound coming from your fuel tank, the fuel pump may be about to fail, since fuel pumps do not normally make noise.

          "description": "Most new vehicles are equipped with an automatic transmission. As a result, there's not really much maintenance to perform. Still, most owner’s manuals will recommend changing the transmission fluid every 90,000 miles or so. Flushing your transmission’s fluid has fallen out of vogue in recent years because the high-pressure cleaning involved may dislodge debris inside the transmission that can literally gum up the works. By following your vehicle’s maintenance schedule, your car’s gearbox will offer years of trouble-free driving. For more information check with your owner’s manual and your dealership service advisor.\n",

          "description": "A transmission takes your engine’s energy and delivers it to the wheels that drive your vehicle.  It is one of the most major – and expensive – repairs you can do. A transmission can fail for almost as many reasons as there are parts inside, and often, it’s easier to replace it than repair it. You are not only paying for the new or rebuilt replacement transmission but also for the labor required to remove the old unit then replace it with a new one. A time-consuming operation, this involves disconnecting fluid lines, electrical wiring, engine mounts, exhaust system components, axles or driveshafts and more. A transmission replacement can be performed by a transmission specialist or by a technician at your dealership’s service department. It is always better to avoid having to go this route by explicitly following the service schedule found inside your vehicle’s owner’s manual. ",

Without coolant being circulated, the engine will overheat, leading to premature wear and damage. A failing water pump can also leak causing further loss of coolant. Water pumps are designed to last at least 100,000 miles, however, if your water pump fails, you should replace it with a high-quality original-equipment level unit. Less expensive replacement pumps are available, but they might only have a service life of 30,000 miles.",

When you hear a growling or grinding noise from your wheel or wheels, it might be indication that bearings are failing, usually due to a lack of lubrication. The noise will grow progressively worse and there will be a certain roughness to the ride of your car, truck or SUV. It may also be evident by a vibration that travels up your steering wheel. The longer you drive on failing bearings, the more expensive the damage to your vehicle can be. Depending on the vehicle and its front, rear or all-wheel-drive, repairs can be quite involved. Brakes and rotor assemblies are removed first to expose the axle nut and hub assembly. The old bearings are removed and replaced with new units and then reassembled. A certified mechanic at your dealership service department or at a local automotive repair center can do the replacements.  ",

Typically, a set of wheel locks will include four locks (one lock per wheel) and at least one key to put the wheel locks on and off. Remember where you put the key and also to never over-torque the wheel lock to the lug nut. ",
